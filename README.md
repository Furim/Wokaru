As new user u will have to create database that will store your password using Algos that u can decrypt and encrypt data such as AES256, then if u open the program it will ask you do u want to add password if u do database is edited and program is closed, database is also encrypted with your key or master password so u can store your database where u want and then decrypt it to get your passwords that u added to database.
